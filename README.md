<h1>Feed.me</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
Feed.me is a React-Native app that fetches recipes and their respective data to summarize them and show cards on the home page.
These cards, when clicked, will redirect to a details page, with ingredients and their respective images, as well as a button that
leads the user to a website with the recipe directions. I am using the <a href="https://developer.edamam.com/">Edamam API</a> to get the
data of the recipes as a JSON, therefore all the structure of the app is made to the interface of this API. If you want to use another one, 
feel free to do so, just bear in mind to change the way you retrieve the information wanted. Anyways, it's a very simple app I made to test my
knowledge and learn new stuff.
